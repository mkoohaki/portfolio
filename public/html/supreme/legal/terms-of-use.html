            <p>As a valued customer, we want you to know that we care and we vow to ensure you have a great retail experience with us. Returned items must be in mint condition, unwashed and unworn within 7 days after receiving order. (socks, and under-garments are not eligible for return/exchange unless defective. All Mystery item(s)/ boxes, Premium Brands (ex. Supreme, Bape, etc.) are FINAL SALE.) For any returns after 7 days, will receive a Streetwear Official store credit via email of the amount paid. Evaluation process may take up to 14 days from receipt. Original Shipping fees are non-refundable. Return shipping costs are the customer's responsibility. A 25% restocking fee will be assessed on orders that are refused by the customer at the time of delivery or returned due to an "un-deliverable" address. We recommend that you obtain a tracking number when returning your package. If packages are not checked in at the warehouse and you do not have tracking the return may not be processed. Please note: If your return has been approved you will receive the credit within 3-5 business days depending on your card issuer’s policies.</p>

            <h2>Exchange Policy</h2>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Unfortunately, we do not accept exchanges. Our reasoning is simple. Our products are in high demand and if you send back the item you want to exchange, there is no guarantee we will still have what the item(s) that you want at that time. However, simply return your package by following our return procedure. We will issue you a store credit via email once we've received your return. That way, you may use the credit towards the correct item/size or for another item.</p>
